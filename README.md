# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview </br>
In this analysis we are reviewing the ride-shareing data by city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural
## Results
Based on the results, the average fare was significantly higher in 2019 in Urban city compared to Suburban & Rural cities.

There are significantly less rural rides and drivers than urban & suburban, but their average fares are higher.

## Summary
In making future decisions on where to concentrate efforts by PyBer, a major consideration should be to where the most of their earnings are received-- urban city types. It is still important, however, to understand the value of rural & suburban cities, but with the understanding that the volume will be less, in both drivers and riders. Therefore, maintaining an eye on classifications of cities (as cities grow, assumingly their types will grow as well) is important to maintain a good balance of where PyBer's attentions are focused.
